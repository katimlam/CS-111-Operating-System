This project includes:
	Two C source files: server.c and client.c
	Makefile
	my.key
	README

The client.c file has the implementation of a client program that reads from
keyboard and transfers the data via TCP connection to the server program. It
support three options, --port=<portnum>, --log=<logfile>, and --encrypt. 
--port is required to take an argument of port number of the connection. 
--log is optional and it record the data received and sent via the connection.
--encrypt is an optional flag. When enable, it encrypt before sending data to connection
and decrypt when receiving data from connection. The encryption and decryption method is 
twofish cfb.

The server.c file has the implementation of a server program that transfer data between the 
connection and the shell process. It supports two arguments, --port=<portnum> and --encrypt.
--port is required to take an argument of port number of the connection. 
--encrypt is an optional flag. When enable, it encrypt before sending data to connection
and decrypt when receiving data from connection. The encryption and decryption method is 
twofish cfb.

my.key contains a 16-byte string key that is used in the encryption process.

Makefile supports the following functions:
make: compile and create executables for both server.c and client.c
make client: only compile and execetables for client.c
make server: only compile and execetables for server.c
make dist: create a tarball
make clean: delete all executables
